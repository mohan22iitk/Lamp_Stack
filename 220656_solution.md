## Your zeroth approach below

Reasoning - 
Got error while running the zeroth.c so changed the type of ved[] to char.

So tried "man" command on terminal.

## Your second approach below (strings.txt)

Reasoning - 
Tried ls, find command to get the location of strings.txt but couldn't found.
Extracted Lamp_Stack_Task.zip using command "unzip Lamp_Stack_Task.zip"
Again tried find command and found the strings.txt at location Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/1/5/0/3/strings.txt
View content of file strings.txt using "cat Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/1/5/0/3/strings.txt"
Now search the string in the current directory recursively using grep command e.g. grep -r "string" which has password

```
Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/final.txt
Lamp_Stack_task/question_mark/Lamp_Stack/eleven.txt
```

## Your third approach below (fourth.zip)

Reasoning -
Unzip using command "unzip fourth.zip"
Search the string in directory using "grep -r DevOps{"
String found in get_in/4/2_inner/0.txt

```
DevOps{y0ur3_4w350m3_4nd_0ne_5t3p_c1053r}
```
